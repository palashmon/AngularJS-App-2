# AngularJS App 2

Simplest case example of an AngularJS app using angular-route.
It loads muliple pages in same div using ng-template, and all of the pages are in different places not in same page.

Single page application (SPA) is a web application that fits on a single page. 
All our code (JS, HTML, CSS) is retrieved with a single page load. 
And navigation between pages performed without refreshing the whole page.

## Note

Please add the application to IIS server or any webserver you have with any name, 
other wise it wont work and it would give some CORS error if you try to lauch it directly using index.html 

Thanks!
